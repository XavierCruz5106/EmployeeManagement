# EmployeeManagement
A simple employee management application using React, Spring Boot, Java. Note: this app is not finished



This is a simple employee management app i made for work. 

It should pretty much work out of the box. 

**NOTE: The actual H2 server runs on port 8081. 
The server expects your react app to be running on the default port 3000; However if you want to change this port,
Navigate to the EmployeeController file and edit the annotation labeled CrossOrigin.

Make sure to run `npm install` first on the client.

after running `npm install`, run `npm start`. The client should be started now.

next, start the server by running running the file `EmployeeMgrServerApplication`, give the server some time to boot up.
after the server is done booting you should be all set to add, edit, delete, and save new users.
